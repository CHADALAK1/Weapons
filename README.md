# Weapons Module

This is a Weapons Module one can add to their Unreal Engine 4 C++ project as a Gameplay Module
Either Link this repo as a submodule or clone this module to create as a submodule on the fly

Overtime this module will have documentation for it's uses. For now, I have the following:

# Item.cpp
# Weapon.cpp
# AmmoComponent.cpp
# StaticMeshWeapon.cpp
# SkeletalMeshWeapon.cpp
