# Weapons Module

This is a Weapons Module one can add to their Unreal Engine 4 C++ project as a Gameplay Module
Either Link this repo as a submodule or clone this module to create as a submodule on the fly

Here's the best part: 

# This project is OPEN SOURCE!

Overtime this module will have documentation for it's uses. For now, I have the following:

# Item.cpp
Weapon is based on Item. Reasoning behind this is to enable weapon to be picked up, dropped, and be stored in an inventory system
# Weapon.cpp
Base functionality of the weapon to be either melee, projectile, or a Trace weapon. More functionality documenation will be implemented
# AmmoComponent.cpp

# StaticMeshWeapon.cpp
Weapon based on using a static mesh
# SkeletalMeshWeapon.cpp
Weapon based on using a Skeletal mesh
